# Chapter F - Design of Members for Flexure

This chapter applies to members subject to simple bending about one principal axis. For
simple bending, the member is loaded in a plane parallel to a principal axis that passes
through the shear center or is restrained against twisting at load points and supports.

## F1. General Provisions

## F2. Doubly Symmetric Compact I-Shaped Members and Channels Bent about Their Major Axis

This section applies to doubly symmetric I-shaped members and channels bent about
their major axis, having compact webs and compact flanges as defined in Section
B4.1 for flexure.

```@autodocs
Modules = [AISCSteel.ChapterFFlexure.F2]
```

## F3. Doubly Symmetric I-Shaped Members with Compact Webs and Noncompact or Slender Flanges Bent about Their Major Axis

This section applies to doubly symmetric I-shaped members bent about their major
axis having compact webs and noncompact or slender flanges as defined in Section
B4.1 for flexure.

```@autodocs
Modules = [AISCSteel.ChapterFFlexure.F3]
```

## F4. Other I-Shaped Members with Compact or Noncompact Webs Bent about Their Major Axis

This section applies to doubly symmetric I-shaped members bent about their major
axis with noncompact webs and singly symmetric I-shaped members with webs
attached to the mid-width of the flanges, bent about their major axis, with compact
or noncompact webs, as defined in Section B4.1 for flexure.

```@autodocs
Modules = [AISCSteel.ChapterFFlexure.F4]
```

## F5. Doubly Symmetric and Singly Symmetric I-Shaped Members with Slender Webs Bent about Their Major Axis

This section applies to doubly symmetric and singly symmetric I-shaped members
with slender webs attached to the mid-width of the flanges and bent about their major
axis as defined in Section B4.1 for flexure.

```@autodocs
Modules = [AISCSteel.ChapterFFlexure.F5]
