So if you are in an environment like Pluto or Jupyter Notebook, you can use @handcalcs to understand what is going on inside the function. You can also use it to generate nice, readable calculations. See here. There is also an extensive demo to see more functionality. See the Handcalcs Demo.","category":"page"},{"location":"WShape Example/#Flexure-Capacity-of-WShape:","page":"WShape Example","title":"Flexure Capacity of WShape:","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"WShape Example/","page":"WShape Example","title":"WShape Example","text":"See link below for the available functions relating to flexure for the WShape member:","category":"page"},{"location":"WShape Example/","page":"WShape Example","title":"WShape Example","text":"Flexure API for IShapes","category":"page"},{"location":"WShape Example/#Major-Axis-Bending","page":"WShape Example","title":"Major Axis Bending","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"WShape Example/","page":"WShape Example","title":"WShape Example","text":"We can calculate the flexural capacity about the x-axis of the W14X90 shape we just constructed:","category":"page"},{"location":"WShape Example/","page":"WShape Example","title":"WShape Example","text":"\nL_b = 20ft\nϕ_b = 0.9\nM_nx = ris.Flexure.calc_Mnx(w, L_b)\nϕM_nx = ϕ_b * M_nx","category":"page"},{"location":"WShape Example/","page":"WShape Example","title":"WShape Example","text":"Lets see what the calc_Mnx function did:","category":"page"},{"location":"WShape Example/","page":"WShape Example","title":"WShape Example","text":"@handcalcs M_nx = ris.Flexure.calc_Mnx(w, L_b)","category":"page"},{"location":"WShape Example/#Minor-Axis-Bending","page":"WShape Example","title":"Minor Axis Bending","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"WShape Example/","page":"WShape Example","title":"WShape Example","text":"We can calculate the flexural capacity about the y-axis of the W14X90 shape we just constructed:","category":"page"},{"location":"WShape Example/","page":"WShape Example","title":"WShape Example","text":"\nM_ny = ris.Flexure.calc_Mny(w)\nϕM_ny = ϕ_b * M_ny","category":"page"},{"location":"WShape Example/","page":"WShape Example","title":"WShape Example","text":"Lets see what the calc_Mny function did:","category":"page"},{"location":"WShape Example/","page":"WShape Example","title":"WShape Example","text":"@handcalcs M_ny = ris.Flexure.calc_Mny(w)","category":"page"},{"location":"#AISCSteel","page":"Home","title":"AISCSteel","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"(Image: Build Status) (Image: Build Status) (Image: Coverage) (Image: Coverage)","category":"page"},{"location":"#AISCSteel.jl","page":"Home","title":"AISCSteel.jl","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"AISCSteel is a Julia package that follows the American Institute of Steel Construction Manual (Sixteenth Edition).
